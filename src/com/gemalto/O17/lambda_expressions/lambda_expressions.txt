Introduced in Java 8

Provides easier way to work with interfaces that only got one method (abstract)

Often used with anonymous classes

It has 3 main parts:
    1. argument list
    2. ->
    3. body

Functional interfaces have a single functionality to exhibit.
For example, a Comparable interface with a single method 'compareTo' is used for comparison purpose.
Java 8 has defined a lot of functional interfaces to be used extensively in lambda expressions.
